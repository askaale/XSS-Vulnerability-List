# XSS-Vulnerability-List
List of websites that I have found Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities over the years, 
which includes URLs of well known websites/brands. Considering the fact that most of
these vulnerabilities were found many years ago, I do not have a POC (Proof of Concept)
images for all of my discoveries. However, I do have records of emails I have sent and
exchanged with people involved with nearly all of the websites being listed below.
In other words, they should be able to confirm this, as the mail is probably logged
both in their system, while I also have a copy.
